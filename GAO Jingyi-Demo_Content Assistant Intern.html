    <h1>Five Books That Shape How We Reflect on Self and Meaning</h1>

    <p><em>By Jingyi Gao | January 2026</em></p>

    <p>
        How do we define an individual in a world shaped by data, profiles, and digital footprints?
         A CV refined by Claude, an artistically constructed Instagram presence, a carefully cultivated Spotify profile, 
         or a vast archive of IMDb ratings? 
         All serve but one purpose: to suggest niche taste, knowledge, experience, and distinction, 
         constructing a performative landscape.

    </p>

    <p>
        In a media landscape shaped by short-form content and rapid consumption, 
        where tools like NotebookLM can easily deconstruct hundreds of pages from masterpieces such as <em>War and Peace</em> in seconds, 
        reading has been framed as an exercise in efficiency, a performative act, rather than a genuine, sustained engagement with the flow of words.

    </p>

    <p>
        However, a true book-lover would not live without the touch of fingers on the page, 
        the unhurried wander through a local bookshop, the coloured sticky notes along the margins....
        Rather, books to them are like breathing. They inhale streams of paragraphs, which, sometimes at the speed of light, 
        sometimes more deeply, as pages soften or wrinkle under the pressure of fingertips. 
        And then, through the lightest pencil marks, the quick strokes of a pen, or the steady tapping of a keyboard, 
        those absorbed words are exhaled as thought, tentative at first, then urgent, 
        later gathered, shaped, and woven together to complete a larger puzzle.

    </p>

    <h2>Fiction</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong><em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em></strong><br>
            A meditation on identity, memory, and choice, where language moves fluidly
            between narrative and philosophy. The novel suggests that meaning is not
            discovered all at once, but negotiated through repetition, contradiction,
            and lived experience. 
    
        </li>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                “The heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth,
                the more real and truthful they become.”
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <cite>— Milan Kundera</cite>
    
        <li>
            <strong><em>1984</em></strong><br>
            Beyond its political force, <em>1984</em> is a study of how language shapes
            inner life. Orwell’s prose demonstrates how the erosion of words leads to
            the erosion of thought, underscoring the necessity of personal engagement
            with language.
        </li>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                “If thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.”
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <cite>— George Orwell</cite>

    </ol>
    
    <h2>Non-Fiction</h2>
    
    <ol start="3">
        <li>
            <strong><em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em></strong><br>
            Camus confronts the search for meaning without illusion, proposing that
            clarity comes not from answers, but from sustained engagement with the
            absurd. The text models thinking as a slow, deliberate process rather than
            a conclusion to be reached.
        </li>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                “The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart.”
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <cite>— Albert Camus</cite>
    
        <li>
            <strong><em>One-Way Street</em></strong><br>
            Fragmentary and reflective, Benjamin’s work mirrors modern experience,
            asking readers to assemble meaning from interruption. It rewards attentive
            reading and reflects how identity is formed amid distraction and flux.
        </li>

        
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                “Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.”
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <cite>— Walter Benjamin</cite>
    
        <li>
            <strong><em>Ways of Seeing</em></strong><br>
            Berger reconsiders how we look, interpret, and assign meaning. By slowing
            perception, the book reveals how identity is shaped not only by what we
            see, but by how we are taught to see.
        </li>

        
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                “The way we see things is affected by what we know or what we believe.”
            </p>
        </blockquote>

    <p>
        Consider this short piece as an invitation to slow down and return to reading in its earlier, quieter contexts,
        moments when we sit or stand with a book in hand, immersed in the scent of ink and paper, 
        and allow the written words to offer brief refuge from the noise of movement and the ordinariness of the mundane. 
        Reading, in this sense, is an event that brings us a pause from performance, a space where the roles we carry can be set aside, 
        and where conversation unfolds not through an intended display, but through words themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
        To return to reading is not to retreat from the new, but to re-embrace novelty at a slower, more profound pace.
        It is in these conversations with narratives and ideas that we traverse doubt, reflection, and re-examination. 
        In these quieter exchanges, pre-defined perceptions are reshaped, long-held assumptions are unsettled, 
        and understanding is rebuilt with kindness rather than haste. 
        With focused attention and openness, in the encounter with the unfamiliar and the search of novelty,
        we rediscover the world we inhabit, and ultimately, find a path back to a more grounded sense of self.

        Note: This article is presented as a working demonstration rather than a finished editorial piece. 
        It reflects a preliminary exploration of basic HTML formatting alongside an initial attempt at copywriting for a blog-style context. 
        Given the conceptual depth and complexity of the books referenced, 
        the introductory notes provided for each title are intentionally concise and illustrative, rather than comprehensive reviews. 
        The primary focus of this demonstration lies in content structure, tone, and editorial flow, 
        with the surrounding text polished to reflect a realistic blog-writing scenario.
